Status: STARTING IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

ENHANCEMENT MODE STATUS CHECK:
- Total features: 658
- Passing: 253 (38.4%)
- Failing: 405 (61.6%)
- Baseline: 215 features

REGRESSION CHECK:
❌ REGRESSION DETECTED: Baseline was 215, but features 204-208 are now failing
  - These features were deferred in previous session as requiring custom impl
  - They are within the baseline range but were not implemented

FAILING FEATURE CATEGORIES:
1. Icon Library (11 features): 204-208 + scattered (371, 582, 634, etc.)
2. Mermaid Diagrams (51 features): 258-308
3. AI Generation (71 features): 309-383
4. Other/Collaboration (272 features): 384-657

DECISION: Implement Icon Library Features (204-208)
Rationale:
- Smallest cohesive feature set (5 features)
- Fills important gap in TLDraw canvas functionality
- Required for professional diagram creation
- Blocks features 323-325 (AI icon intelligence integration)
- High user value: 3000+ cloud provider icons

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Feature 204: Icon library with 3000+ icons (AWS, Azure, GCP, SimpleIcons)
2. Feature 205: Icon search with fuzzy matching
3. Feature 206: Icon categories organized by provider and type
4. Feature 207: Recent icons quick access
5. Feature 208: Favorite icons with star functionality

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
Phase 1: Backend
  - Create icon library data structure
  - Implement icon metadata API endpoints
  - Icon search/filter endpoints
  - Recent/favorites persistence

Phase 2: Frontend
  - Create IconLibrary React component
  - Implement search UI with fuzzy matching
  - Category browser component
  - Recent icons panel
  - Favorites panel with star UI
  
Phase 3: TLDraw Integration
  - Add icon library to insert menu
  - Custom shape for cloud icons
  - Drag-drop icon insertion
  - Icon rendering on canvas

Phase 4: Testing
  - E2E tests for all 5 features
  - Browser integration tests
  - Regression testing

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Leverage existing icon_intelligence.py for icon metadata
- Use TLDraw custom shapes API
- Store recent/favorites in localStorage
- Fuzzy search with Fuse.js or simple Levenshtein
- Icon SVGs from @aws-icons, @azure/icons, simple-icons npm packages
