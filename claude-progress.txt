# AutoGraph v3.1 Enhancement Session Progress

## Project Context
- Mode: BUGFIX/ENHANCEMENT
- Base: v3.0 (658 features baseline)
- Target: v3.1 (Foundation solid, browser-tested, production-ready)

## Critical Issues (from enhancement_spec.txt)
Priority P0:
1. Frontend bypasses API Gateway - direct calls to :8082 instead of :8080
2. Save diagram fails in browser (works via curl)
3. Old diagrams don't exist in database

## Services Status
✅ Frontend (Next.js) - Port 3000 - RUNNING
✅ API Gateway (FastAPI) - Port 8080 - RUNNING
✅ All backend services - Healthy (Docker)
✅ Infrastructure - PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO ready

## Session 1 - Initial Assessment
