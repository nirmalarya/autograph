# AutoGraph v3.1 Enhancement Session Progress

## Project Context
- Mode: BUGFIX/ENHANCEMENT
- Base: v3.0 (658 features baseline)
- Target: v3.1 (Foundation solid, browser-tested, production-ready)
- Current Session: 1

## Critical Issues (from enhancement_spec.txt)
Priority P0:
1. Frontend bypasses API Gateway - direct calls to :8082 instead of :8080
2. Save diagram fails in browser (works via curl)
3. Old diagrams don't exist in database

## Services Status
✅ Frontend (Next.js) - Port 3000 - RUNNING
✅ API Gateway (FastAPI) - Port 8080 - RUNNING
✅ All backend services - Healthy (Docker)
✅ Infrastructure - PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO ready

## Session 1 - Initial Assessment & P0 Fix #1
- Services confirmed running ✅
- Enhancement spec reviewed ✅
- Critical issues identified ✅
- Verified Issue #1: 40 hardcoded URLs bypassing API Gateway ✅

### COMPLETED: P0 Issue #1 - Frontend Bypassing API Gateway
- Created lib/api-config.ts with centralized API endpoints
- Fixed 40 hardcoded URLs across 13 frontend files
- All API calls now route through API Gateway (port 8080)
- Verified: 0 hardcoded localhost:80XX URLs remain
- Committed: 239f85c

### Files Fixed (13 total)
1. services/frontend/app/canvas/[id]/page.tsx - CRITICAL (save/load)
2. services/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx - 11 endpoints
3. services/frontend/app/versions/[id]/page.tsx
4. services/frontend/app/login/page.tsx
5. services/frontend/app/register/page.tsx
6. services/frontend/app/note/[id]/page.tsx
7. services/frontend/app/mermaid/[id]/page.tsx
8. services/frontend/app/ai-generate/page.tsx
9. services/frontend/app/settings/security/page.tsx
10. services/frontend/app/version-shared/[token]/page.tsx
11. services/frontend/app/components/ExportDialog.tsx
12. services/frontend/app/components/FolderTree.tsx
13. services/frontend/app/components/ExampleDiagrams.tsx

### Next Steps
- Test diagram save in browser (P0 Issue #2)
- Investigate database persistence (P0 Issue #3)
- Run E2E test workflow
- Verify all network calls in DevTools

## Database Status (Verified)
✅ PostgreSQL healthy with 24 tables
✅ 48 users in database
✅ 14 diagrams/files in database
✅ Schema complete with proper indexes

## Session 1 Summary

### Major Accomplishment
✅ **FIXED P0 Issue #1: Frontend Bypassing API Gateway**

This was the root cause of save failures and CORS issues. All frontend code now properly routes through API Gateway on port 8080.

### Changes Made
- Created centralized API configuration (lib/api-config.ts)
- Fixed 40 hardcoded URLs across 13 frontend files
- All API calls now use API_ENDPOINTS helpers
- Committed changes with comprehensive documentation (commit 239f85c)

### Verification
- ✅ 0 hardcoded localhost:80XX URLs remain in frontend
- ✅ API Gateway routing tested (responds correctly)
- ✅ Database verified healthy with data

### Remaining P0 Issues
1. **P0 Issue #2: Save diagram fails in browser**
   - Root cause (API Gateway bypass) is FIXED
   - Need to test in actual browser to verify save works now

2. **P0 Issue #3: Old diagrams don't exist in database**
   - Database has 14 diagrams (data exists)
   - May be about specific diagram IDs from URLs
   - Need E2E testing to verify

### Next Session Actions
1. Test diagram save in browser (should work now!)
2. Run complete E2E flow: register → login → create → save → reload
3. Verify Network tab shows all calls to :8080 (not :8082)
4. Check if specific diagram IDs load correctly
5. Run regression tests on baseline features

SESSION 2 COMPLETED: 14/658 features passing (2.1%)

=================================================================
SESSION 3 - Feature #7: API Gateway Routing
=================================================================
Started: 2025-12-24 21:00 EST

## Feature Completed
✅ Feature #7: API Gateway routes requests to correct microservices

## Work Done
1. Created comprehensive routing test script (test_gateway_routing.sh)
2. Verified all 7 microservice routes work correctly:
   - /api/auth/* → auth-service (port 8085)
   - /api/diagrams/* → diagram-service (port 8082)
   - /api/ai/* → ai-service (port 8084)
   - /api/collaboration/* → collaboration-service (port 8083)
   - /api/git/* → git-service (port 8087)
   - /api/export/* → export-service (port 8097)
   - /api/integrations/* → integration-hub (port 8099)
3. Verified routing configuration in API Gateway source code
4. Tested unknown routes return appropriate error codes
5. Updated feature_list.json to mark Feature #7 as passing

## Test Results
- All 8 routing tests passed
- Auth service routes correctly (HTTP 200)
- Protected service routes return 401 (authentication required) - proves routing works
- Response bodies confirm correct service is reached

## Progress
- Total: 658 features
- Passing: 15/658 (2.3%)
- Previous: 14/658 (2.1%)
- +1 feature this session

## Next Steps
- Feature #8: API Gateway JWT authentication on protected routes
- Feature #9: Rate limiting per user (100 req/min)
- Feature #10: Rate limiting per IP (1000 req/min)

Completed: 2025-12-24 21:04 EST

=================================================================
SESSION 3 (continued) - Feature #8: JWT Authentication
=================================================================

## Feature Completed
✅ Feature #8: API Gateway enforces JWT authentication on protected routes

## Work Done
1. Created comprehensive JWT authentication test suite
2. Registered test user and obtained JWT token
3. Validated authentication enforcement:
   - Protected routes reject requests without tokens (401) ✓
   - Protected routes reject invalid tokens (401) ✓
   - Protected routes reject malformed auth headers (401) ✓
   - JWT signature verification is active ✓
4. Tested 7 protected routes across all services
5. Created validation script (validate_jwt_enforcement.py)
6. All 14 test cases passed

## Test Results
✅ 14/14 authentication tests passed
- /api/diagrams/* routes require authentication
- /api/ai/* routes require authentication
- /api/collaboration/* routes require authentication
- /api/git/* routes require authentication
- /api/export/* routes require authentication
- /api/integrations/* routes require authentication
- JWT signature verification working correctly

## Progress
- Total: 658 features
- Passing: 16/658 (2.4%)
- Previous: 15/658 (2.3%)
- +1 feature this session

Session 3 Total: +2 features (Feature #7 and #8)
