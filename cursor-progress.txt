TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

Feature #130 - Restore from Trash Implementation:

POST /{diagram_id}/restore
- Restores diagram from trash to active state
- Clears is_deleted flag and deleted_at timestamp
- Only works on trashed diagrams (is_deleted=True)
- Returns 404 for non-existent or active diagrams
- Authorization enforced (only owner can restore)

Key Code Changes:
```python
@app.post("/{diagram_id}/restore")
async def restore_diagram(
    diagram_id: str,
    request: Request,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Get diagram from trash (is_deleted=True)
    diagram = db.query(File).filter(
        File.id == diagram_id,
        File.is_deleted == True
    ).first()
    
    if not diagram:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Diagram not found in trash")
    
    # Check authorization
    if diagram.owner_id != user_id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized")
    
    # Restore: clear is_deleted flag and deleted_at timestamp
    diagram.is_deleted = False
    diagram.deleted_at = None
    
    db.commit()
    
    return {
        "message": "Diagram restored from trash",
        "id": diagram_id,
        "title": diagram.title,
        "restored_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
```

Complete Trash Lifecycle:
1. User deletes diagram → Soft delete (is_deleted=True)
2. Diagram moves to trash (30-day retention)
3. User can restore from trash → Restore (is_deleted=False) ✨ NEW
4. User can permanently delete from trash → Hard delete
5. Hard delete removes diagram and all versions

================================================================================

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. API Response Structure
   - List endpoints return paginated responses with metadata
   - Need to access 'diagrams' key, not use response directly
   - Always check API response structure before writing tests
   
2. Service Restart Process
   - Use virtual environment Python for correct dependencies
   - Kill processes completely before restarting
   - Wait for service to fully start before testing
   - Check health endpoint after restart
   
3. Trash Lifecycle Design
   - Restore only works on trashed diagrams (is_deleted=True)
   - Active diagrams return 404 on restore (not in trash)
   - Clear both is_deleted and deleted_at on restore
   - Authorization enforced throughout lifecycle
   
4. Test Design
   - Test all edge cases (non-existent, unauthorized, active)
   - Verify both database state and API responses
   - Check diagram appears/disappears from lists
   - Test complete workflow end-to-end
   
5. Error Handling
   - Return 404 for not found in trash
   - Return 403 for unauthorized
   - Return 200 for success
   - Include helpful error messages
   
6. Code Organization
   - Keep related endpoints together
   - Follow consistent patterns (delete, restore)
   - Use same authorization checks
   - Maintain consistent logging

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

Restore Pattern:
```python
@app.post("/{diagram_id}/restore")
async def restore_diagram(
    diagram_id: str,
    request: Request,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Get from trash only
    diagram = db.query(File).filter(
        File.id == diagram_id,
        File.is_deleted == True
    ).first()
    
    if not diagram:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Diagram not found in trash")
    
    # Check authorization
    if diagram.owner_id != user_id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized")
    
    # Restore
    diagram.is_deleted = False
    diagram.deleted_at = None
    db.commit()
```

Query Patterns:
```python
# Active diagrams only (for list, get, update)
diagram = db.query(File).filter(
    File.id == diagram_id,
    File.is_deleted == False
).first()

# Trashed diagrams only (for restore, hard delete)
diagram = db.query(File).filter(
    File.id == diagram_id,
    File.is_deleted == True
).first()
```
