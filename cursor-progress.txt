TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

Feature #105 - Permission Check: Only Owner Can Delete

Already Implemented:
- Delete endpoint checks if diagram.owner_id != user_id
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized delete attempts
- Works for both soft delete and hard delete
- Error message: "Not authorized to delete this diagram"

Verification:
- User B cannot delete User A's diagram (403 Forbidden)
- User A can delete own diagram (200 OK)
- Diagram moved to trash after soft delete
- User B cannot hard delete User A's diagram from trash
- User A can hard delete own diagram
- Diagram permanently deleted (404 Not Found)

Feature #106 - Permission Check: View-Only Share Access

Implementation:
```python
# Check authorization - user must own the diagram OR have edit permission via share
has_permission = False
permission_source = None

if diagram.owner_id == user_id:
    has_permission = True
    permission_source = "owner"
else:
    # Check if user has edit access via a share token
    share_token = request.headers.get("X-Share-Token")
    if share_token:
        share = db.query(Share).filter(
            Share.token == share_token,
            Share.file_id == diagram_id
        ).first()
        
        if share and share.permission == "edit":
            # Check if share is still valid (not expired)
            if share.expires_at is None or share.expires_at > datetime.now(timezone.utc):
                has_permission = True
                permission_source = "share_edit"
        elif share and share.permission == "view":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403, 
                detail="You have view-only access to this diagram"
            )
```

Key Features:
- X-Share-Token header for share authentication
- Checks share permission (view vs edit)
- Checks share expiration
- Returns specific error for view-only access
- Logs permission source for audit trail

Verification:
- User B can access diagram via view-only share
- User B cannot edit with view-only share (403 Forbidden)
- Error message: "You have view-only access to this diagram"
- Diagram not modified after failed edit attempt
- Owner can still edit

Feature #107 - Permission Check: Edit Share Access

Implementation:
- Uses same authorization logic from Feature #106
- Allows edit if share permission is "edit" and not expired
- Delete endpoint only allows owner (no share support)

Verification:
- User B can access diagram via edit share
- User B can edit diagram with edit share (200 OK)
- Changes saved (title, canvas_data, note_content)
- Version incremented after edit
- User B cannot delete with edit share (403 Forbidden)
- Owner can delete

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. Authorization Best Practices
   - Always check ownership first
   - Then check alternative permissions (shares)
   - Return specific error messages for each case
   - Log permission source for audit trail
   
2. Share Permission Hierarchy
   - Owner: full control (view, edit, delete)
   - Edit share: can view and edit, cannot delete
   - View share: can only view, cannot edit or delete
   - Clear separation of concerns
   
3. Security Headers
   - X-Share-Token for share authentication
   - Separate from X-User-ID (user authentication)
   - Allows flexible permission checking
   - Easy to audit and log
   
4. Error Message Specificity
   - "You have view-only access to this diagram" (view share)
   - "Not authorized to delete this diagram" (edit share trying to delete)
   - "You do not have permission to update this diagram" (no access)
   - Helps users understand why action failed
   
5. Testing Strategy
   - Test positive cases (allowed actions)
   - Test negative cases (forbidden actions)
   - Test boundary cases (expired shares)
   - Test owner still has full control
   - Verify no side effects from failed attempts
   
6. Code Reuse
   - Feature #107 reused authorization logic from #106
   - Single implementation, multiple test scenarios
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Easier to maintain
